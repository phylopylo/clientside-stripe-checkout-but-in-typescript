I'm cheap and I don't wanna spend money on a monthly subscription to Shopify or anybody else. Stripe is nice because they just take a cut off of every transaction. I also don't want to worry about maintaining and paying for a VPS for this project, so I also need this to just work client-side. The original project works great, I just need to repackage the base functionality to be compatible with my project's stack.
